# FullStackFables

## Background

We are students of the ALX- Software Engineering Program training to become Full Stack Developers. This repository was created to document our journey, and solidify our understanding.

This repository is based on the idea to simulate the workings of a company. Where every new concept we learn is applied to solve 'real-life problems' in our company.

Each directory in this repository is a solution to a problem that could arise in the day to day running of our company!
